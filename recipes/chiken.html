      <b>Descrição:</b> We developed this chicken zoodle soup in a jar, inspired
      by recipes on TikTok for soup in a jar. It's a great make-ahead meal that
      you can make year round.

      <li>4 teaspoons chicken stock base</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground sage</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 2/3 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups spiralized zucchini</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir together chicken stock base, garlic, dried rosemary, ground sage,
        and black pepper in a small bowl. Divide mixture evenly among 3
        microwave-safe pint-size canning jars with lids.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer evenly with chicken, spiralized zucchini, carrot, celery, and
        sweet onion. Chill, covered, up to 5 days. To serve, see “Heat and Eat”,
        below. Season with pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let jar stand at room temperature 10 minutes or run under warm water 1
        minute. Add water (about 1 cup) to ingredients in jar until nearly full.
        Microwave (without lid) 3 minutes. Carefully screw on lid (jar will be
        very hot); let stand 5 minutes. Invert jar to combine ingredients. Eat
        out of jar or transfer to a bowl to serve.
